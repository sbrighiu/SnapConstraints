/// ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS .snap ;)
///
/// # Useful information ahead:
///
/// - Constraints are added as soon as they are created. 
/// * Views who are subject to SnapConstraints have .translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints 
/// set to false automatically.
/// - This framework is optimized to hide as many negative values as possible. If a constraint 
/// is not shown properly, try setting the constant as a negative value, and maybe check if you 
/// are using the correct type of SnapConstraint. 
/// * The SnapManager contains internal logging and SnapConstraints options. Please modify as you wish.
/// - The framework is build around SnapConstraintTypes and constraints can be created by accessing
/// any child of UIView, and using the variable '.snap' to initiate the chaining of constraints and mask.
/// Yup, **chaining and masks**, you heard right.
/// * All constraints created can be retrieved immediately by using the .snaps methods on the view they are
/// added to. 
///
/// # Future work:
/// This framework allows you to do a lot of things, but most importantly, it will signal, in the 
/// near future, when you are trying to do something prohibited by your view hierarchy, and most of 
/// the time, it will help you do it in a safe way ;). Some of the issues are: 
/// 1. 1000/999 priority changes
/// 2. multiplier change after the creation of a constraint
/// 3. ... and more to come
///
/// Configure SnapConstraints settings
///
